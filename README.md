Open source AI demo to showcase the deployment of an AI application stack on existing infrastructure. Initially designed to keep data on-prem.

The first iteration of this project is the implementation of a natural language pipeline which can receive JSON events and then randomly select template variations to convert key value pairs into natural language sentences.

This repo may end up being the training data assitant, receiving JSON and writing data for a model to issue similarity scores. Not sure yet.
